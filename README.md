# Ascii-art-web-export-file

## Description
Ascii-art-web-export consists on making sure that it is possible to export the output of the web application, at least in one export format at your choice.

    You should be able to export the result of the ascii-art project implemented in the website.
    The file must be exported with the right permissions (read and write) for the user.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (www). When sending a file or image as part of the HTTP response we must include the use of HTTP headers.

Headers used for file transfer are `Content-Type`, `Content-Length` and `Content-Disposition` and more if needed, but for this project you will be obligated to use those headers.
